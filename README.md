## Project Title:

**Car Recommendation System Based on User Preferences**

---

## Project Description:

This project is a **Used Car Recommendation System** designed to help users easily find suitable vehicles from a dataset based on their preferences. The system takes user inputs such as **fuel type**, **transmission type**, **price range**, and **body type**, then filters and ranks cars from the dataset that meet these criteria.

The recommended cars are displayed as **informative cards**, presenting key details like the car‚Äôs **name, make, model, price, fuel type, transmission, drivetrain, exterior and interior color, body type, number of doors, and number of cylinders**. This ensures that potential buyers or users can quickly view, compare, and choose cars that match their preferences.
